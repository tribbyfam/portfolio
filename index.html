      <h3>About me</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p> I graduated from Tashkent's Topographical School (Uzbekistan) with degree in cartography and passion for
        making maps. When I came to U.S. I followed my interest in maps and entered Hunter college which I graduated
        with B.S. degree in geography. Job search took me to Department of City Planning where I landed my first map
        making job in NYC.</p>
      <p>When I started making maps back in Uzbekistan we used pencils for drowing and stencils for ingraving
        techniques for making paper maps. At DCP we used software
        like SmallWorld and later ESRI ArcGIS, that produced static computer maps files or paper products. Technology
        now makes it possible to create
        interactive, dinamic maps that let a user to select their own criteria, which make maps lot more fun. These
        advances in technology ignited an interest in me to
        learn programing skills. I entered NYCDA boot camp for software engeneering intensive. Upon completion of which
        I have strong fundamentals knowledge of full stack programming. My projects section has work I've done at
        NYCDA. I would like to advance with my new skills and would like to apply them in making new interactive maps.</p>
